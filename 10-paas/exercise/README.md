# Exercise: PaaS with Vercel

Vercel is a serverless PaaS specializing in modern web frontends.  
You can use a variety of frameworks and set up automated deployment and hosting with just a few clicks.

## Task 1

Create a [free Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup/).

## Task 2

Use Vercel to create a GitHub repository and deploy a template of your choice.  
Ensure the deployment was successful. You can now access the deployed website in your browser.  
The domain can be found directly in Vercel.

## Task 3

Clone the generated repository. Modify the JavaScript/TypeScript files in the repository.  
Commit the changes and push the updates.  
You should be able to track the build process in Vercel.  
Within minutes, your updated version should be live under the same domain.

### (Optional) Storage

Vercel also offers integrated storage solutions through partners,  
making it easy to build smaller yet fully functional products entirely on Vercel.  
Try out options like Redis or Postgres:
