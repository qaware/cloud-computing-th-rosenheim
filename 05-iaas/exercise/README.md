# Practice session IaaS

In today's practice session you will get yourself familiar with the AWS management console, setting up infrastructure with terraform and using the aws cli.
It is split in 3 parts, where the first 2 parts require an AWS account, the third does not. 

It is unlikely you manage to work through all 3 parts, therefore I suggest you pick part 1 & 2. 
In case you have no access to an AWS account, work through part 3.

## Warm Up (Optional): Getting familiar with Terraform

Walk through the interactive terraform lab https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code?in=terraform/aws-get-started#quick-start.

## Parts 

[Part - 1](./aws-part-1) Setting up infrastructure using the AWS Management console  
[Part - 2](./aws-part-2) Setting up infrastructure in AWS with terraform  
[Part - 3](./localstack) Setting up infrastructure locally with terraform and localstack
